\section{Moving Forward} % (fold)
\label{sec:moving_forward}

Tactile metaphors for perception, even for non-tactile modes of awareness such as vision and audition, are primordial and persistent. In trying to understand what, if anything, makes these tactile metaphors for perceptual awareness apt, we undertook a phenomenological investigation of grasping or enclosure, understood as a mode of haptic perception. So far we have identified at least one feature of haptic presentation that might be generalized to other forms of sensory presentation. Specifically, if a tangible quality is present in haptic experience, the conscious character of that experience is constitutively shaped by the tangible quality presented in it, at least relative to the perceiver's haptic experience. The proposed general thesis, then, is that the conscious character of a perceptual experience is constitutively shaped by its object, at least relative to its presentation to the perceiver's partial perspective. More would have to be done to fully defend this general thesis. Among other things, that there is an analogue of visual perspective in each of the sensory modalities would have to be justified. (Can we really have a perspective on an odor, say?) In this chapter and the next, I will say more about the applicability of this idea to vision and audition at least. But what of the other important claim that was made about the metaphysics of haptic perception, that haptic presentation is governed by the principle of sympathy? Does sympathy operate in other modes of sensory presentation? Does sensory presentation require the operation of sympathy quite generally? If so, how are we to understand this?

It was natural to appeal to sympathy to explain how felt resistance to the hand's activity in grasping or enclosure discloses the overall shape and volume of the object grasped, since we began by thinking of haptic perception in terms of the Secret Doctrine that Socrates attributes to Protagoras in the \emph{Theaetetus}. Just as on the Protagorean model, perception is the joint upshot of forces in conflict, grasping or enclosure, understood as a mode of haptic perception, is itself naturally understood as the joint upshot of forces in conflict. On the one hand, there is the force of the activity of the grasping hand. On the other hand, there are the self-maintaining forces of the rigid, solid body. Making an effort to more precisely mold the hand to the body's contours and the resistance of the self-maintaining forces that determine that body's rigidity and solidity together give rise to an experience of that body's overall shape and volume. In trying to determine whether sympathy operates in non-haptic modes of sensory presentation, we shall begin by determining whether this Protagorean model can be extended to other sensory modalities. Kilwardby, for one, thought it did: ``Two motions come together as if from opposite parts in sensing'' (\emph{De Spiritu Fantastico} 112, \citealt[]{Broadie:1993dz}). Though, of course, the Protagorean model finds its expression in the reconciliation of Peripatetic and Augustinian metaphysics it offers Kilwardby:
\begin{quote}
	One motion proceeds from a sensible thing which causes an alteration, and through the medium this enters to the sense organ and its innermost part where it is united with the sensory soul. The other motion proceeds from the sensory soul to meet the affect which is produced in the sense organ. In the meeting of these motions, an image of a sensible thing is formed in the sensory soul by the action of the sensory soul which attends to its sense organ, and by means of this image a thing is sensed. (\emph{De Spiritu Fantastico} 112, \citealt[]{Broadie:1993dz})
\end{quote}

Smith's \citeyearpar{Smith:2002sa} discussion of \emph{Anstoss} suggests one way one might generalize from the haptic case. Haptic perception arises from the conflict between the grasping hand and the self-maintaining forces of the rigid, solid body. Reaching out and grasping something is a clear example of voluntary intentional action. Moreover, at least in the case of haptic perception, the hand is, among other things, a sensory organ. Putting these ideas together, it is the voluntary intentional movement of sensory organs that are the activities whose force comes into conflict with the perceptual object. In visual case, then, it is the movement of the eyes in their sockets, and not saccadic movement which is relevant, since the latter is involuntary and non-intentional. Smith faces some difficulties, not necessarily insuperable, with this proposal. For example, unlike other animals, humans cannot cock their ears, though we may turn toward a sound to better hear it. This is not, however, the only way to generalize from the haptic case. 

Reaching out and grasping something may be a voluntary, intentional movement of a sensory organ, but insofar as it is a mode of perception, it is a psychological activity as well. Consider Cook Wilson's claim (\emph{Correspondence with Stout, 1904}, \citeyear{Cook-Wilson:1926sf}) that in order to feel something in an object, a rough texture say, one must feel that object, and in order to weigh something, one must weigh it. If grasping is understood analogously with feeling and weighing, then this suggests an alternative generalization. On this alternative, in order to hear something, one must listen. And in order to see, one must look. Grasping, feeling, weighing, listening, and looking, while they may or may not involve the intentional movement of sensory organs, they are not themselves reducible to such movements when they do. They are, perhaps, more aptly described as a kind of perceptual stance, sustained by a characteristic activity, where the perceiver opens themselves up, in a directed manner, to experiencing different aspects of the natural environment. In engaging in such activities, in directing perceptual awareness in this way, the perceiver contributes to making different aspects of the natural environment perceptually available.

\section{The Berkeley--Heidegger Continuum} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_berkeley_heidegger_continuum}

``In order to hear well,'' Maine de Biran observes, ``it is necessary to \emph{listen}.'' How does listening, the activity of listening out for something, come into conflict with the objects of audition such that these may be sympathetically presented in auditory experience? We can make progress with this question by first getting clearer on the objects of audition, on what there is to listen out for.

We hear sounds. Do we hear, as well, their sources? Philosophers divide on this question. And even those philosophers who maintain that we hear both sounds and their sources divide as to how we do so. Philosopher's views on these matters can be useful represented on a continuum that ranges from Berkeley on the one extreme and Heidegger on the other (see \citealt{Leddington:2014aa} for a similar suggestion). 

\citet{Berkeley:1734fk} follows Aristotle in taking sounds to be the proper objects of audition. For something to be the proper object of a given sensory modality it must be perceptible in itself and perceptible to that sensory modality alone. That a sensory modality having a proper object does not preclude it from having other objects as well. Thus we can see motion and feel motion. Berkeley thus extends the Peripatetic account in claiming, in addition, that sounds are the sole objects of audition. We hear no other thing. In a way, this is a return to an earlier, Platonic view. Plato, in the \emph{Theaetetus} (184 e 8--185 a 3), maintained that a sensory capacity just is the capacity to present its proper objects. Our auditory capacity, so conceived, just is the capacity to present its proper object, sound. So on Berkeley's view, strictly speaking, we hear sounds and not their sources. In part, Berkeley argues for this by distinguishing sounds from their sources by an application of Leibniz's Law. Sounds have auditory qualities that their sources lack, and insofar as sources lack auditory qualities they are inaudible. 

% (\citealt{Smith:2002sa} is an example of a contemporary philosophers who espouses the Berkelean view.) 

The neo-Berkelean accepts that sound is the proper object of audition. They accept as well that the auditory qualities of sounds distinguish them from their sources. But they deny that sound is the only object of audition. The sources of sound that can be perceived by other sensory modalities, such as sight, are also the objects of audition, but only derivatively---we hear the source of the sound by hearing the sound. According to the neo-Berkelean, Berkeley goes too far in denying that we hear the sources of sound. Berkeley mistook sound's being the direct or immediate object of audition for sound's being the sole object of audition. If we allow sources to be the indirect or mediate objects of audition---in the sense that we hear sources by hearing sounds---, then the objects of audition include not only proper sensibles but common sensibles as well.

However, in ``The Origin of the Work of Art'' Heidegger presents an opposing view:
\begin{quote}
    We never really first perceive a throng of sensations, e.g., tones and noises, in the appearance of things \ldots; rather we hear the storm whistling in the chimney, we hear the three-motored plane, we hear the Mercedes in immediate distinction from the Volkswagen. Much closer to us than all sensations are the things themselves. We hear the door shut in the house and never hear acoustical sensations or even mere sounds. \citep[151--152]{Heidegger:1935uq}
\end{quote}
Nothing hangs on Heidegger's apparent acceptance of the empiricist identification of sound with acoustic sensation. What is important is Heidegger's denial of the central neo-Berkelean claim, that we hear the source of sound by hearing the sound. Rather, we hear the source of sound directly.

In undergoing an auditory experience, the source of a sound is directly or immediately present in that experience. When we attend to our auditory experience, as Heidegger invites us to, we attend to the sources of sounds and rarely, if at all, to the sounds in distinction from their sources. That is consistent with maintaining that hearing a source necessarily involves accoustical sensation. And yet Heidegger is clearly denying the neo-Berkelean claim that he hear the source of a sound by hearing the sound. That is a negative result about how to characterize acoustical indirection: There is more to hearing a source by hearing its sound than the necessary accompaniment of the former by the latter.

Heidegger exaggerates when he claims that we never hear acoustical sensations or mere sounds. For he goes on to maintain that we can manage to hear sounds in distinction from their sources only by adopting the aural equivalent of the painterly attitude:
\begin{quote}
    In order to hear a bare sound we have to listen away from things, divert our ears from them, i.e., listen abstractly. \citep[152]{Heidegger:1935uq}
\end{quote}
We can get a sense of how difficult it is to adopt this attitude by considering Pierre Schaeffer's piece ``Étude aux chemins de fer'' (1948). Whereas traditional composition begins with an abstraction, the score, which is made concrete in playing it, \emph{musique concrète} begins with concrete sounds and abstracts them into a composition through tape looping and sound collage. Yet despite these distancing techniques, the material sources never completely fade from the perceived soundscape. We get a sense of the train's speed, its size, the space surrounding the tracks as well as the space of the interior given the character of the resonance. Working in Schaeffer's studio, Karlheinz Stockhausen addressed these problems in the method of tape composition deployed in ``Étude'' (1952). He recorded prepared low piano strings struck with an iron bar and sliced off the heads of the recorded sounds, thus eliminating information about the attack and other material features of the source. These short headless segments were further repeated to form the basic tones of the piece. The effect is uncanny. However, the very uncanniness is itself partly a product of the limitation, or at least a variant of it, that beset Schaeffer's earlier piece. The tones are uncanny in that there are at once unfamiliar, indeterminate, and yet familiar, though, enigmatically, placing them proves elusive. Indeed, at the end of his career, Schaeffer pronounced \emph{musique concrète} a failure, claiming, perhaps ironically, to have wasted his life. Heidegger's observation was the principle obstacle---it is very difficult to listen away from things and hear bare sounds, to hear sounds without also hearing their sources. And so there are limits to the degree of abstraction that can be achieved with \emph{musique concrète}. It is telling, in this regard, that Stockhausen abandons tape composition for the generation of tones with sine-wave generators as he continued to explore electronic composition.

The Berkelean alternative raises an explanatory challenge to the neo-Berkelean---\-to explain how we can experience a source by experiencing its sound. The Heideggerian alternative is a challenge to the very possibility of such an explanation. At the very least, in undergoing an auditory experience, we do not attend to sources by attending to sounds---according to Heidegger, in normal cases, there is no sound that we are attending to. A neo-Berkelean cannot afford to be as sanguine about the Heideggerean alternative as they may be tempted to be about the Berkelean alternative. A promissory note is worth nothing in the face of an inability to repay.

In this chapter, I propose to simply set the extreme Berkelean alternative to one side and accept that we hear, in addition to the sounds, their sources as well.

\section{Sounds and Their Sources} % (fold)
\label{sec:sounds_and_their_sources}

The objects of perception are particulars. Perception is a primitive kind of conscious encounter, and one can only encounter particulars. Entities of diverse ontological categories count as particulars. Thus not only are ordinary material substances particulars, but so are property instances, states, or at least their obtainment, events, and processes.

Colors are spatially extended, at least in the sense of being instanced only by spatially extended things. We can imagine smaller and smaller things being colored, but we cannot conceive of a thing without extension exhibiting color. Similarly sounds are temporally extended. We can imagine hearing briefer and briefer sounds, but we cannot conceive of sound without duration. 

The temporal dimension of sound, however, is not exhausted by their having a beginning and an end. In this regard they are no different from mortal animals. But unlike natural substances such as animals and other objects, as well as entities of distinct ontological categories such as states, sounds have a distinctive way of being in time. Like events, at least as the three-dimensionalist conceives of them, sounds unfold in time (see \citealt{Fine:2006fk}; though for criticism see \citealt{Sider:1997fk,Hawthorne:2008uq}). Unlike states which are wholly present whenever they obtain, sounds are not wholly present at every instant of their sounding. They are spread over the interval of time through which they unfold. So sounds have a temporal mode of being that events have. Perhaps some sounds, such as the sound of the wind, or the roar of a waterfall, are more like processes than events \citep[4]{Broad:1952kx}. However, that distinction is not presently relevant, and at any rate, processes are no more wholly present at each moment of their occurrence than events. Since sounds are spread over time, their sensory presentation must also be. That sounds are not wholly present at every instance of their sounding precludes them from being wholly present in auditory experience at every instant of their hearing. Auditory experience unfolds with its object. So auditory presentation, due to the distinctive temporal nature of sound, has duration. Auditory presentation is the disclosure of a sound unfolding through its temporal interval. It discloses its object, then, over time, just like haptic presentation. However, whereas haptic perception may disclose events, it discloses, as well, relatively static features such as texture and temperature. Sounds, by contrast, are essentially dynamic entities, not wholly present at any moment of their existence but unfolding in time. 

Sounds may be particular events or processes, and so have a mode of being that suffices to distinguish them from entities belonging to other ontological categories such as bodies and states, but what of other \emph{audibilia}? Must all audible objects unfold through time? Or is this just a feature of, according to the Peripatetic tradition, the proper objects of audition? 

According to \citet[4]{Broad:1952kx}, we ordinarily speak of hearing bodies. So when Big Ben strikes the time, and is in earshot, we can say that we can hear Big Ben. However, Broad concedes little in acknowledging this point of usage since he also observes that it takes but a little pressure to convince ``the plainest of plain men'' that ``hearing Big Ben'' is shorthand for ``hearing Big Ben striking''. If we accept Broad's suggestion, then we only hear Big Ben insofar as it is a participant in a sound-generating event. And when we do, what we strictly speaking hear is Big Ben striking and not Big Ben, that is, not the body, but an event the body participates in that is the cause of the propagation of the patterned disturbance. It is not clear that Broad thinks that even Big Ben striking is an object of audition. ``Hearing Big Ben'' is meant to be equivalent to ``hearing such and such a noise and taking it to be coming from Big Ben''. But taking the sound that one hears to be generated in an event in which Big Ben participates may be a cognitive, rather than a perceptual, activity or stance. Let us set aside any doubts that Broad may have entertained, and accept, with Heidegger, that we hear not only the sound of Big Ben striking but we hear, as well, Big Ben striking. The view we will have arrived at is one according to which we hear sounds and their sources. Sounds are events or processes and their sources that we hear are the events and processes that generate those sounds. Such a view would be a step closer to vindicating the general claim that audibilia, and not just sounds, have the distinctive temporal mode of being of events or processes. Full vindication would further require assurance that sounds and their sources are all that we, strictly speaking, hear.

Allow me to elaborate on sources and their hearing and a engage in speculation about a hypothetical sense in which we may be said to hear bodies.

First, the elaboration. It concerns the sources of sound. In the discussion above, for convenience, I have silently substituted a philosophically motivated precisification for the ordinary notion. Specifically, sources were claimed to be sound-generating events or processes. While it is true that the ordinary notion of a source is a causal notion, we also speak of objects or bodies being the sources of sound. We do so presumably because these bodies possess the causal power to engage in an activity which is a sound-generating event or process. In effect the precisification identifies sources with the body's activity that generates a sound. The \emph{prima facie} plausibility of this is abated in a philosophical \emph{milieu} where a broadly Humean metaphysics, with its focus on regularities among events, remains widely influential. For the broadly Humean framework encourage the conclusion that sources are events from the recognition that sources are causal. However, the precisification of the ordinary notion was not motivated by a Humean metaphysics. I believe that we should accept the Eleatic Visitor's teaching and acknowledge the being of capacity. (After all, it would be impious to deny the existence of virtue.) But once we do, we can see how sources may be, at once, bodies and causal. Bodies may be the sources of sound by possessing the causal power to sound, to engage in a sound-generating activity. The precification was not motivated by an adherence to a broadly Humean metaphysics but rather had a phenomenological motivation. Specifically, we are presently interested in the sources that we can be said to hear. The sources that we can be said to hear may be a narrower class than what may ordinarily be described as a source. Big Ben is a source of sound. But we don't hear Big Ben---at least not strictly speaking---, we hear Big Ben striking. What we hear, strictly speaking, is not the body but the body's sound-generating activity. 

Both sounds and the sources that we hear are like events or processes in that they are not wholly present at every instant of their occurrence. The speculation, intimated above, is that perhaps this is a general feature of \emph{audibilia}. Perhaps for something to be present in auditory experience it must have a particular temporal mode of being, it must unfold through time. This would preclude, by their very nature, entities such as bodies from being present in auditory experience since they would lack the requisite temporal mode of being. Earlier we noted Broad's helpful suggestion that perhaps ``hearing Big Ben'' is elliptical for ``hearing Big Ben striking''. 

As plausible as this may be, a worry may still persist. One of the uses to which audition may be put is to track a body's progress through the environment. We can listen to an animal's approach, say. And it might be thought that we are attending to the animal in audition in so listening out for them. Moreover, it might seem insufficient for the body to be attended to, that an event in which that body participates is present in auditory experience. Not every part of a visible body is seen, so why assume that every participant of an audible event is heard? How can we listen out for bodies, even though they are precluded, by their temporal mode of being, from being present in auditory experience? 

Bodies may not be present in auditory experience, but perhaps they figure in the content of auditory experience in another way, as the intentional object of the experience, or something very much like it. Bodies are, on the speculative hypothesis that we are entertaining, not present in auditory experience. Thus bodies are absent in auditory experience. And yet we can attend to bodies in audition. How could this be? Aristotle uses this kind of puzzle or \emph{aporia} about presence in absence to argue for, as we might put it, the intentional character of memory (\emph{De Meomoria et Reminiscentia} 450\( ^{a} \)25--451\( ^{a} \)1). The Peripatetic response to the puzzle is to straightforwardly accept the claim of absence and reinterpret what purported to be a presentation instead as a kind of re-presentation. When one remembers Corsicus in his absence one contemplates a \emph{phantasma} caused by a previous perception of Corsicus and one conceives of the \emph{phantasma} as a likeness and reminder of Corsicus as he was perceived. How might the Peripatetic response, so abstractly described, be applied to the perceptual case of attending in audition to bodies? Memory and imagination are plausibly primitive intentional capacities in our cognitive economy in contrast with perception, \emph{pace} \citet{Burge:2010uq}. But perhaps what is present in auditory experience may, nevertheless, constitute a natural image of what is absent. That is, perhaps we can understand hearing the body's sound-generating activity as providing the listener with a dynamic aural image of the body. It is an image, indeed, as I have suggested, a natural image, like a fossil or a footprint \citep[for a recent general discussion of images see][]{Kulvicki:2014hb}. But unlike paradigmatic images it is not a visual image but an aural image (for the denial that there so much as could be such a thing see \citealt{Martin:2012af}). And while visual images are static, aural images, if such there be, would be dynamic as befitting their aural character. Hearing Big Ben striking, then, would provide the listener with a dynamic aural image of Big Ben and its activities. Perhaps hearing Big Ben, while not the presentation of Big Ben in auditory experience, involves hearing Big Ben striking as a dynamic aural image of Big Ben. In order for this to be so the auditory presentation of a sound-generating event must involve at least the partial disclosure of the event's participants. Audition partially discloses an event's participant by presenting it as a participant of the audible event. It is the body's participation in the event, and not the body \emph{per se}, that is part of the event's audible structure. The disclosure of such audible structure is partial. There may be no guarantee that if a perceiver hears an event, they hear each of its participants. But that is consistent with audition, in certain circumstances of perception at least, partially disclosing some of the participants in the unfolding audible event. It is only if we can hear Big Ben's participation in its striking that we can use that hearing to attend to Big Ben. It is only if we can hear Big Ben's participation, can that hearing provide us with a dynamic aural image of Big Ben and its activities.

\section{The Wave Theory} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_wave_theory}

An ancient tradition identifies sound with motion. Plato and Aristotle claimed that sound is a motion in a medium. In the cosmology of the \emph{Timaeus} (67 a--c), sound is percussion in the air and the hearing of that sound is the movement it causes through the ears of the perceiver. For Aristotle, sound is motion in an elastic medium, be it air or water (\emph{De Anima} 2 8 420\( ^{a} \)8--11, 420\( ^{b} \)11, \emph{De Sensu} 447\( ^{a} \)1--2, though see \citealt[60--1]{OCallaghan:2007xy} for an alternative interpretation). But the hearing of the sound, while it may involve the sound's acting upon the ears, the organs of audition, is no mere alteration but the exercise of a capacity (\emph{De Anima} 2 5). Conceptions of sound as motion in a medium were common in the Middle Ages if variously developed \citep{Pasnau:2000aa}. For present purposes we shall understand The Wave Theory, more specifically, as identifying sound with a certain kind of event, the propagation of a patterned disturbance through an elastic medium such as air or water. Notice, on The Wave Theory, herein understood, the sound event is not the patterned disturbance---longitudinal pressure waves---in an elastic medium so much as it is the propagation of a patterned disturbance through that medium. 

The Wave Theory, so understood, is subtly but crucially different from the view that \citet{OCallaghan:2007xy} dubbed The Event View. On both views, sounds are particulars, indeed, particular events. But whereas on The Wave Theory, the event is the propagation of the patterned disturbance through an elastic medium, on The Event View, sounds are the events that cause a patterned disturbance to propagate through a medium. On The Wave Theory, the sound event, in a perfectly elastic medium, may be envisioned as an ever expanding sphere, the patterned disturbance propagating in every direction from the source (\citealt{Sorensen:2009aa}; compare also Lucretius \emph{De Rerum Natura} \textsc{iv} 603--7, \citealt{Smith:2001aa}: ``Moreover, a single utterance distributes itself in all directions \ldots. And so voices crowd places hidden away from sight and make them all astir and alive.''). It is like an expanding ripple caused by a drop in an otherwise calm body of water, except the sound event occurs in three dimensions, not two, and so takes the form of a sphere rather than a circle. On The Event View, the sound event exhibits no such structure. Rather, it is the striking, bowing, grinding, vibrating, resonating, \ldots\ whatever kind of event involving the material source sufficient to propagate a patterned disturbance through an elastic medium, should there be one. This last qualification reveals a further important difference. Whereas on The Wave Theory, the existence of sound depends upon a medium in which the event transpires, on The Event View, sound is existentially independent of a medium. An event involving a material source may be sufficient to cause the propagation of a patterned disturbance through an elastic medium and may yet occur in the absence of such a medium. The existential independence of sound from a medium on The Event View thus allows for sound in a vacuum in the way The Wave Theory could not.

The Wave Theory, on the present understanding, is an idealized refinement of a traditional view. It represents a metaphysical genus, or class of views, insofar as it admits of further refinements. Are sound events, as The Wave Theory conceives of them, plausibly the objects of audition?

Traditionally, the phenomenology of auditory experience was thought to support The Wave Theory, or at least some version of it. (Though there are, of course, contemporary dissenters. Their concerns are addressed in the subsequent section~\ref{sec:phenomenological_objections}) After all, our auditory experience seems to present an emanative phenomenology. Within auditory experience, sounds appear to emanate from their sources. Sounds are heard to come from their sources. And, at least in the context of The Wave Theory, it is natural to understand this as the phenomenological reflection, in auditory experience, of the direction of the propagation of the patterned disturbance. If it is, then an emanative phenomenology potentially contributes to the fitness of the animal, at least with its capacity to hear ecological sound, since the direction of the propagation of the patterned disturbance carries important information about the location of its source. Hearing the approach of another can be of vital concern be it predator or prey.

In ``Elementary reflections on sense-perception'', \citet{Broad:1952kx} provides a careful description of the emanative phenomenology of audition, by contrasting the hearing of sounds with the seeing of colors. Colors are seen to inhere in the surfaces of bodies in a spatialtemporal region located at a distance from the perceiver:
\begin{quote}
	But the noise is not literally heard as the occurrence of a certain sound-quality within a limited region remote from the percipient's body. It certainly is not heard as having any shape or size. It seems to be heard as coming to one from a certain direction, and it seems to be thought of as pervading with various degrees of intensity the whole of an indefinitely large region surrounding the centre from which it emanates. \citep[5]{Broad:1952kx}
\end{quote}
In this passage, Broad makes clear not only the sense in which a sound is heard to emanate from its source, but he also connects this aspect of auditory phenomenology with a thesis in the metaphysics of sound. For suppose that this emanative phenomenology of auditory experience were determined by an aspect of what it presents, then the sounds that we hear would involve a propagation, in every direction, from the source, of patterned disturbance that can vary as it travels through an imperfectly elastic medium. That is to say, Broad is explicitly linking the emanative phenomenology of auditory experience, if veridical, with The Wave Theory. \citet{Broad:1952kx}, however, should not be read as necessarily endorsing The Wave Theory here. The description of the emanative phenomenology of auditory experience is part of a larger task of specifying the phenomenological differences between vision, audition, and touch, phenomenological differences that are ultimately belied by the common causal mechanisms that underly all of our sensory modalities.

The Wave Theory not only coheres with, and would explain well, the emanative phenomenology of auditory experience, if veridical, but it would explain, as well, ordinary practices of identifying and re-identifying sound. Ordinarily, we allow that two perceivers located at different distances from a material source may hear the same sound, though at different times, and though their experience of that sound may differ. The sound may be louder for the perceiver located nearer the source, for example. And so the experience of the sound for the perceiver located near and far may differ, and yet it is the same sound that they hear. When invited to envision the sound event, as The Wave Theory conceives of it, as an ever expanding sphere, we were invited, as well, to make a certain idealization, that the medium through which the patterned disturbance propagates is perfectly elastic. Of course, the air and water through which we normally hear sounds are imperfectly elastic. And that is presently relevant. For that means that the patterned disturbance will erode as it propagates through the imperfectly elastic medium. As it loses energy, it will become, not only less loud, but fine detail of the top end will be lost early on and perhaps only the bass will persist the furthest. That the two perceivers, located at different distances from the source, hear the sound at different times is due to the different distances the patterned disturbance had to propagate from the source to reach them. And that the auditory experience of the two perceivers differ in character is due, in part, to the erosion of the patterned disturbance as it propagated through an imperfectly elastic medium. Nevertheless, they can be said to hear the same sound since sound, on The Wave Theory, is not identified with a patterned disturbance but with the propagation of a patterned disturbance through an elastic medium. If sound were identified with a patterned disturbance, then since the patterned disturbance differed in the auditory stimulation of the two perceivers, they would be hearing different sounds. But if sound were, instead, identified with a propagation of a patterned disturbance through an elastic medium, the two perceivers may be said to hear the same sound even if they are hearing it at different stages of its career.

\section{Phenomenological Objections} % (fold)
\label{sec:phenomenological_objections}

According to \citet{Pasnau:1999ss}, if The Wave Theory were true, then auditory experience would be illusory. According to Pasnau we do not hear sounds pervading a volume, at least not normally, rather we hear sounds as located at their sources:
\begin{quote}
	We do not hear sounds as being in the air; we hear them as being at the place where they are generated. Listening to the birds outside your window, the students outside your door, the cars going down your street, in the vast majority of cases you will perceive those sounds as being located at the place where they originate. At least, you will hear those sounds as being located somewhere in the distance, in a certain general direction. But if sounds are in the air, as the standard view holds, then the cries of birds and of students are all around you. This is not how it seems (except perhaps in special cases \ldots). \citep[311]{Pasnau:1999ss}
\end{quote}
Other recent writers who have made similar claims about the distal character of experienced sound include \citet{Casati:1994aa} and \citet{OCallaghan:2007xy}.

Auditory experience, so conceived, lacks the emanative phenomenology that \citet{Broad:1952kx} contrasts with the phenomenology of color vision. Rather, sounds are heard to be confined to the remote spatiotemporal region of their origin. Indeed,  \citet{Pasnau:1999ss} understands the distal senses of vision and audition, at least, as being on a par. And since Pasnau follows Locke in treating sounds as sensible qualities (though see \citealt{Pasnau:2009ys}), he is led to conceive of auditory experience as affording the perceiver with awareness of auditory qualities confined to the remote spatiotemporal region of their source. In this way is the analogy of audition with vision, \emph{contra} Broad, completely reinstated. 

Allow me to make a brief digression to highlight an important point of disagreement. \citet{Pasnau:1999ss} commitment to a Lockean metaphysics of sound is incidental to the aim of that paper which is concerned with whether sound qualities inhere in the medium or in the distal source. That question, or a version of it, can be posed without assuming the Lockean metaphysics: Is sound located in the medium or at or near its source? Though incidental to the aim of the paper, the Lockean metaphysics of sound was not unmotivated. Rather, Pasnau is moved by the idea that sensible objects belong to a common metaphysical genus. This is a monism of the sensible. Later, \citet{Pasnau:2009ys} abandons the Lockean metaphysics of sound, coming to conceive sounds as particular events. However, given the monism of the sensible, and the dynamic aspects of the physics of color generation, Pasnau suggests that colors might themselves be events, the event of color. Allow me to register a disagreement, though without offering a reason, it is perhaps merely the expression of a difference in intellectual temperament. Rather than thinking of sensible objects belonging to a common metaphysical genus, I am impressed by the heterogeneity of the sensible. Far from adhering to the monism of the sensible, on Austinian grounds, I am attracted to a pluralism of the sensible. Just consider the diversity of \emph{visibilia} alone. We see opaque material bodies such as Price's \citeyearpar{Price:1932fk} red tomato, but we also see transluscent volumes, reflections, shadows, holes. Perhaps as \citet{Sorensen:2004jk,Sorensen:2008kx,Sorensen:2009aa} suggests, we can see darkness and hear silence. I raise the issue without pursuing it. The important point is whether there is unity or diversity in the metaphysics of sensible objects is potentially relevant to the kind of explanatory role they may play. End of digression.

Pasnau's argument raises a couple of questions. The first question concerns the metaphysical commitments of The Wave Theory. If according to The Wave Theory, sounds have locations, where are the sounds, so conceived, located? The second question concerns the phenomenology of auditory experience. In cases where perceivers genuinely hear something in a distance are what they hear sounds or some other audible object? 

Begin with the second question, about the phenomenology of auditory experience, first. When one listens to the birds outside one's window, the students outside one's door, and the cars going down one's street, what is it that one is listening to? A flat-footed answer would be: birds, students, and cars. But birds, students, and cars, while audible, are not themselves sounds but their sources, at least potentially. But the claim that the source of a sound is heard to be confined to a spatiotemporal region remote from the perceiver is not inconsistent with the sound it generates pervading the surrounding medium. Pasnau moves too quickly from cases involving hearing a distal source to concluding that the sound itself is heard to be remote from the perceiver. Once we allow that we hear not only sounds but their sources, a question naturally arises whether the audibly distal object that we hear is the sound or merely its source.

\section{A Tension} % (fold)
\label{sec:a_tension}

The case of audition reveals a tension within the Peripatetic framework. Consider the following two claims about the proper sensibles:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item Proper sensibles are perceptible to one sensory modality alone (for example, one can see colors, but not hear, smell, taste, or touch them)
	\item Proper sensibles are the final cause of the exercise of the sensory modality (for example, sight is for the sake of seeing colors in the light and the luminous in the dark)
\end{enumerate}
The difficulty is that, at least in the case of audition, these two claims cannot be true together.

Consider the second claim first, that the proper sensibles are the final cause of the exercise of the sensory modality. The proper object of sight is the visible (\emph{De Anima} 2 7 418\( ^{b} \)27) and there are two kinds of \emph{visibilia}, color which is visible in light and the luminous, such as bioluminescence or starlight, visible only in the dark (\emph{De Anima} 2 7 419\( ^{a} \)1--7). If sight is for the sake of seeing colors in the light and the luminous in the dark (\emph{Metaphysica} \( \Theta \) 8 1050\( ^{a} \)10), then is audition for the sake of hearing sounds? If, as I have suggested, sounds are merely the medium through which distal sources are heard, then it is more plausible to suppose that audition is for the sake of hearing these distal sources. More specifically, the function of the auditory system would be to afford the perceiver with auditory awareness of distal events in the natural environment. Suppose, then, that audition is for the sake of hearing distal sources. Arguably it is that in which audition's selective advantage lies. Hearing sounds would be incidental to audition, so conceived, at least relative to its end, even if one can only ever hear sources through the sounds they generate. The difficulty is that the final cause, the distal sources, are perceptible to more than one sense alone. Thus one might hear one of London's feral parrots calling as one sees that parrot calling. So there is no one thing that is audible yet perceptible to no other sensory modality and that for the sake of which we possess audition. (1) and (2) are generalizations that fail for the case of audition. Perhaps sounds are audible and perceptible to one sense alone and so would make (1) true but (2) would fail---audition is not for the sake of hearing sounds but their sources. The audible sources of sound would make (2) true but (1) would fail---audible sources may be available to more than one sense. 

That (1) and (2) fail to be jointly true of audition signals the breakdown of the guiding explanatory framework of \emph{De Anima} 2.

	It is necessary for the student of these forms of soul first to find a definition of each, expressive of what it is, and then to investigate its derivative properties, \&c. But if we are to express what each is, viz. what the thinking power is, or the perceptive, or the nutritive, we must go farther back and first give an account of thinking or perceiving; for activities and actions are prior in definition to potentialities. If so, and if, still prior to them, we should have reflected on their correlative objects, then for the same reason we must first determine about them, i.e. about food and the objects of perception and thought.

Aristotle's explanatory strategy has two parts. Specifically, Aristotle proposes to explain perceptual capacities, first, in terms of what they are the capacity for, perceiving. Second, perceptual activities, the exercise of our perceptual capacities, are themselves to be partly explained in terms of their proper objects, understood as sensible object perceptible to that sense alone. Audition poses a challenge for the second part of Aristotle's explanatory strategy. The first part of Aristotle's explanatory strategy is simply motivated by the idea that potentialities are individuated by what, for the sake of which, they are the potential for. It is not that idea that is threatened so much as the idea that the relevant perceptual activity must be understood in terms of the presentation of a sense object proper to that sense modality. It is not the thought that the perceptual activities that are the exercise of perceptual capacities are prior in account to these capacities that is challenged. Rather it is the Platonic idea that perceptual capacities should be understood in terms of the presentation of an object available through the exercise of that capacity alone (\emph{Theaetetus} 184 e 8--185 a 3). Thinking of perceptual capacities as individuated by that for the sake of which they are a potential for, allows Aristotle to think that there are exercises of our perceptual capacities that are not the presentation of the proper sensibles, notably, when they are the presentation of a common sensible. In this way, Aristotle broadens the domain of the perceptible \citep{Sorabji:1971fr,Sorabji:2003fk,Kalderon:2015fr}. But in continuing to understand the presentation of proper sensibles as that for the sake of which a perceiver possesses the relevant perceptual capacity, Aristotle cleaves too closely to the Platonic tradition undone by audition whose function is to afford the pereiver awareness of distal events in the natural environment that are perceptually available to other sensory modalities, such as a storm whistling in the chimney.
