\section{Grasping and the Rhetoric of Objectivity} % (fold)
\label{sec:grasping_and_the_rhetoric_of_objectivity}

Haptic perception plays a privileged role in the rhetoric of objectivity. In chapter~\ref{sec:a_puzzle}, we discussed two historical exemplars of this rhetorical impulse, the Giants shaking trees and boulders at the Friends of the Forms as they affirm their materialism, and Dr Johnson's kicking the stone outside of the church in Harwich as an exasperated affirmation of its material existence independent of our ideas. While by no means dead, this rhetorical trope has, perhaps, lost some of its sheen in giving birth to the late twentieth-century clich\'{e} of the table-pounding realist.

I once attended a lecture, where the speaker pounded on the podium at each mention of an objective worldly correlate of our conceptual scheme. Through this performance, the philosopher was expressing the objectivity of the worldly correlate, and, in a rather bullying fashion, demanding our assent to it. Like Dr Johnson's performance, it was a multimodal affair (chapter~\ref{sec:a_puzzle}, \citealt[71]{Campbell:2014aa}). The audience, in sympathetically responding to the philosopher's tactile experience, is meant to vividly experience the tangible resistance of the podium, revealed, in part, in the loud, sharp sound it produces when pounded. It is this resistance to touch that is meant to disclose the podium to be objectively there, independently of the speaker's pounding, just as the worldly correlate is meant to be there, independently of our conceptual scheme.

Haptic perception plays a privileged role in the rhetoric of objectivity. It does so, in part, because the experience of felt resistance to touch is phenomenologically vivid and primitively compelling. Though in no doubt about the presence or solidity of a thing, we may, nevertheless, be drawn to touch it. Thus we must endeavour to teach our children to keep their hands to themselves, and even in maturity, polite notices are required to remind adults to not touch the display cabinet. Aristotle discerns an existential concern in touch. While the distal senses, such as sight and audition, are for the well-being of an animal equipped with locomotion, touch is for that animal's very existence. Perhaps this existential dimension is part of what makes touch primitively compelling. Haptic perception plays a privileged role in the rhetoric of objectivity, in part, because the experience of felt resistance to touch is phenomenologically vivid and primitively compelling. Moreover, it plays a privileged role, as well, because grasping provides a model for perceptual objectivity quite generally, in the assimilation of the hand, and the haptic experience it gives rise to, to the object of haptic investigation.

\section{Perceptual Objectivity} % (fold)
\label{sec:perceptual_objectivity}

That perception assimilates to its object is the manifestation of its objectivity. Perceptual assimilation is formal rather than material. The conscious qualitative character of the perceptual experience becomes like the presented object without materially absorbing it. Moreover, the formal assimilation of perception to its object is not exact in the way that would entail the sharing of qualities. The experience of our hominid ancestor, in seeing the alien obelisk, does not itself become black. The qualitative character of their visual experience in seeing the obelisk may be like, in some sense, the blackness presented in it. But that blackness enjoys no natural existence in our hominid ancestor's perception of it the way it enjoys natural existence in the alien obelisk. Perception may be a capacity to become like, as Aristotle contends, but it is not chameleon-like, as Crathorn imagined, and Holcot complained of (chapter~\ref{sec:assimilation}). 

An ineliminable source of the inexactness of perception's formal assimilation to its object consists in its perspectival relativity. Perception only formally assimilates to its object relative to the perceiver's partial perspective (chapter~\ref{sec:assimilation}, chapter~\ref{sec:auditory_perspective}). I have not done enough to defend the general claim that all sensory experience is perspectival. I have not, for example, argued that olfaction is perspectival. I have, however, argued that there are haptic and auditory in addition to visual perspectives. Each allows for better or worse perspectives, and each involves the potential disclosure of previously hidden aspects of an object. While there are similarities among them in virtue of which they each count as a perspective, haptic, auditory, and visual perspectives are also, importantly, distinguished. While each structures a space, not only may the space differ, be it peripersonal or extrapersonal space, but the manner of its structuring may differ as well.

Perception only provides a partial perspective on the natural environment. The object of perception may not be wholly present to the perceiver's partial perspective of it. To that extent, their perception is imperfect in the sense of being incom\-plete---there are perceptible aspects of the object not disclosed to the perceiver's perspective. As \citet[]{Merleau-Ponty:1964aa} stresses, however, perception is not imperfect in a further, normative sense:
\begin{quote}
	But in immediate consciousness this perspectival character of my knowledge is not conceived as an accident in its regard, as an imperfection relative to the existence of my body and its proper point of view; and knowledge by ``profiles'' is not treated as the degradation of a true knowledge which would grasp the totality of the possible aspects of the object all at once. Perspective does not appear to me to be a subjective deformation of things but, on the contrary, to be one of their properties, perhaps their essential property. It is precisely because of it that the perceived possesses in itself a hidden and inexhaustible richness, that it is a ``thing.'' \ldots\ Far from introducing a coefficient of subjectivity into perception, it provides it on the contrary with the assurance of communicating with a world which is richer than what we know of it, that is, of communicating with a real world. The profiles of my desk are not given to direct knowledge as appearances without value, but as ``manifestations'' of the desk. \citep[186]{Merleau-Ponty:1964ab}
\end{quote}
In most cases, the object of perception, in all its particularity, exceeds what is disclosed of it in perceptual experience. Touch provides a vivid example of this in what I earlier described as the allure of the tangible (chapter~\ref{sec:haptic_perception}). The allure of the tangible is the sense, or premonition, that, at any given moment, the body exceeds what is disclosed to us by touch. We have the sense, when touching an object, that it is tangibly determined in ways that we have yet to feel. Our tactile sense of a body's ``thingness''---its concrete particularity---consists, in part, in this allure. While, perhaps, particularly vivid in tactile phenomenology, Merleau-Ponty is maintaining that something like this is true of perceptual phenomenology more generally, that the partial disclosure of the object of perception is an objective manifestation of that object. Far from being an obstacle to perception's objectivity by introducing a coefficient of subjectivity into perception, the perspectival character of perception is what makes possible its objective disclosure of the natural environment. Objectivity and the parochial are linked (for an insightful exploration of this theme, though not within the philosophy of perception, see \citealt{Travis:2011qd}).

To bring out how objectivity and the parochial are linked in perception consider the limits to normal human color constancy. Human color constancy is imperfect. Not only does human color vision display constancy for only some scenes and some conditions of illumination, but human color vision displays different degrees of constancy in different kinds of scenes in different ranges of illumination. Hilbert explains how human color constancy is imperfect in a further important sense:
	\begin{quote}
		Many theories of color constancy take the form of explaining how it is that the visual system manages to extract information about the reflectance of the objects in a scene from the color signal from those objects. Since this involves separating the contributions of the reflectance and the illuminant to the color signal these theories are often characterized as ``discounting the illuminant''. Perfect color constancy in these terms would involve accurate recovery of reflectance for any scene under any lighting conditions. The perceived color of objects would be perfectly correlated with their reflecting characteristics and not vary at all with changes in the illuminant of the composition and arrangement of objects in view. This type of perfect color constancy is not possible. \citep[143]{Hilbert:2007qy}
	\end{quote}
Human color constancy is partial and variable---it holds in different degree in different kinds of scenes in different ranges of illumination. It is also imperfect. As Merleau-Ponty emphasizes, this should not be thought of as a deficit. Suppose there could be a perceiver whose perception displayed perfect color constancy Hilbert's sense. What would it be like for them to see a field of grass set against a blue summer sky? The field would appear uniformly green and the sky uniformly blue. Moreover, no difference in color appearance would differentiate any portion of the uniformly green field. The experience of the scene would be not unlike a young child's drawing of the scene. The grass would be uniformly green and lack the golden cast that we might observe in viewing the same scene, nor would it be dappled, as we observe the scene to be, by sunlight and shadow. Furthermore, no difference in color appearance would differentiate any portion of the uniformly blue sky. The sky would be uniformly blue and would manifest no deepening azure to the east. Children's drawings also intimate what perfect size constancy might be like---they will draw a car as larger than an adult even if the car is at a great distance from that person. Just as with perfect size constancy we would lose information about distance, so with perfect color constancy we would lose information about the illuminant. So the partial and variable character of human color constancy is no deficit. And not merely because it lacks the garish character of children's crayon drawings, but because we would be insensitive to important aspects of our environment. Our environment is only objectively disclosed to the partial perspective we have on it.

Not only does perception formally assimilate to its object, relative to the perceiver's partial perspective, but this formal assimilation is a kind of constitutive shaping. The object present in perceptual experience constitutively shapes that experience, the way that St Paul's constitutively shapes the London skyline. What that skyline is like is determined, in part, by what St Paul's is like. St Paul's determines what the London skyline is like, at least in part, by virtue of being a part or contour of that skyline. Similarly, what the perceiver's experience of an object is like is determined, in part, by what that object is like. The object of perception determines what the perceiver's experience of it is like, at least in part, by virtue of being a constituent of that experience. Constitutive shaping entails formal assimilation, though formal assimilation need not involve constitutive shaping. Consider Locke on primary quality perception. In perceiving a primary quality, the perceiver's experience resembles its object, but not by having that object as a constituent. The object constitutively shaping the perceiver's perceptual experience of it, is, as \citet{Ardley:1958aa}, stressed, the result of the perceiver's ``communion'' with that object. It is the unity of the perception with its object that ultimately explains the similarity between the conscious qualitative character of perceptual experience and the qualitative character of the object presented to the perceiver's partial perspective. (Recall, according to Plotinus, it is because of the unity provided by the World-Soul that potentially distant parts of the sensible cosmos that are suitably disposed to become like or unlike may sympathetically interact. See chapter~\ref{sec:plotinus}. For the generalization and application of this point to the case of haptic perception see chapter~\ref{sec:sympathy_as_the_principle_of_haptic_presentation}.)

It is because this feature of grasping or enclosure, understood as a mode of haptic perception, generalizes to other forms of perception, such as vision and audition, that grasping is an apt metaphor for perception, more generally. If this feature carries over to perception generally, if the object of perception constitutively shapes the perceiver's perceptual experience, then it is easy to see its epistemic significance. If perception involves becoming like the perceived object actually is, then it is a genuine mode of awareness. One can only perceptually assimilate what is there to be assimilated. If perceptual experience is a formal mode of assimilation understood as a mode of constitutive shaping, then one could not undergo such an experience consistent with a Cartesian demon eliminating the object of that experience. If there is no external object, then there is nothing to which the perceiver, or perhaps their experience, could assimilate to. If the phenomenological character of perception is constitutively shaped by the object presented to the perceiver’s partial perspective, then we can begin to see the epistemic significance of perceptual phenomenology. If the phenomenological character of perception is constitutively shaped by the object presented to the perceiver’s partial perspective, then it is the grounds for an epistemic warrant for the range of propositions whose truth turns on what is presented in that perceptual experience \citep{Johnston:2006uq,Johnston:2011fk,Kalderon:2011fk}.

The warrant, here, should be understood as an entitlement to judge (in the ordinary sense of ``entitlement'' and not in Burge's \citeyear{Burge:2003fk} technical sense of the term; compare \citealt[132n]{McDowell:2009ys}). Entitlements may be possessed without being exercised. In being aware of some aspect of the natural environment, the perceiver may possess an epistemic warrant that entitles them to know various things without the warranted knowledge being actualized. So the epistemic warrant grounded in perceptual awareness is a matter of knowledge potential, whether or not such potential is actualized. The epistemic warrant grounded in perceptual awareness is not a factor in terms of which knowledge could be analyzed or otherwise explained. Moreover, it is an \emph{epistemic} entitlement: The object of awareness is an epistemic warrant for the range of propositions whose truth turns on what the perceiver is aware of. Perception confers this epistemic entitlement given the alethic connection between the particular that is the object of perceptual awareness and the proposition potentially known. Awareness of the sensible particulars affords the subject with a reason that is in this way akin to proof---it is logically impossible for the particular to exist and the proposition to be false \citep[see][]{Cook-Wilson:1926sf,Kalderon:2010fk,Travis:2005kx}. Because in seeing the bright green burrs of the ancient chestnut tree, I possess a reason that would, in the given circumstance, warrant my coming to know that the burrs are bright green, I am authoritative about the green of the chestnut tree's burrs. My seeing the bright green of the burrs can stand proxy for any inquiry on your part about the color of the burrs. If in coming to know that the burrs are bright green, I express my knowledge by stating it, I extend to you an offer to take it on my authority that the burrs are the color that I see them to be. 

The present metaphysics of perception, while inconsistent with a Cartesian demon eliminating the object of experience, is not, by itself, sufficient to refute skepticism. Even conceding the conception of perceptual experience as a kind of formal assimilation understood as a mode of constitutive shaping, that conception is nevertheless consistent with the possibility of ringers. This possibility can arise in two ways. The objects of perception, what we perceive, may have ringers. I may see Castor and shake his hands, but his twin, Pollux, is a dead ringer. Moreover, not only do the objects of perception, those sensible aspects of the natural environment that we encounter in experience, admit of ringers, but our perceptual episodes, our experiences, may themselves admit of ringers. A perception of Pollux is a ringer for a perception of Castor, as is a perfectly matching hallucination of Castor. And a skeptic might try to exploit this latter possibility to undermine the epistemic warrant afforded by perception, a warrant not shared with its experiential ringers. The mere existence of experiential ringers is, by itself, insufficient for the skeptic's conclusion. The skeptic would need, in addition, the claim that if a perceptual episode affords the perceiver with epistemic warrant, it must not admit of ringers. (Though this is not the place to go into it, I doubt very much that these further skeptical maneovers could succeed. For a sense of this, see how these ideas work themselves out in the tradition of Oxford realism as discussed in \citealt{Kalderon:2010fk}.)

Perception is a fundamental form of objectivity in our cognitive economy since it affords us explicit awareness of sensible aspects of the natural environment. It is not a fundamental form of objectivity, however, by being a primitive form of objective representation as \cite{Burge:2010uq} contends. Sensory awareness is a mode of assimilation, and something can only assimilate to what is there to be assimilated. Perception involves the objective presentation of its object in the explicit awareness afforded by experience. That object, of which the perceiver is explicitly aware, is only subsequently re-presented, if at all, in imagination and memory. \emph{Pace} Burge, I favor, instead, the Peripatetic doctrine that imagination and memory, and not perception, are the basic forms of intentional or representational capacities in our cognitive economy. That is, we are presented aspects of the natural environment in our perceptual experience of it, and these aspects are only subsequently re-presented, if at all, in imagination and memory. Perception is the basis of an epistemic warrant not by making the perceiver aware of a truth, though recognition of what one is perceiving may afford such awareness. Rather perception affords awareness of those aspects of the natural environment upon which the truth of a variety of propositions depend.

Moreover, sensory awareness, the explicit awareness afford by perception of the natural environment, as opposed to awareness of truths about that environment, is epistemically distinctive. Information can go stale. What once passed for knowledge may accrete into dogma if the world changes without a corresponding change in cognitive state. The explicit awareness afforded by perceptual experience, in contrast, keeps the perceiver \emph{au courant} with their environment. In disclosing, partially and imperfectly, that environment, their perceptual experience will change with every change of what is presented in it. If timeliness is important in your practical circumstances, perception offers a distinct advantage over, not only belief, but what passes for knowledge. If you value timeliness, given your practical circumstances, if being \emph{au courant} with some aspect of the natural environment is of particular practical significance, then you should keep an eye on it or, at least, be perceptually vigilant, more generally.

That perception assimilates to its object, in the sense that it does, is due, in part, to the activity of the perceiver. Perhaps that is why Olivi describes the outward extensive activity of perception as being, at the same time, a formative absorption toward its object.  The haptic experience of our hominid ancestor only assimilates to the stone thanks to the activity of their hand's grasp and the resistance it encounters. It is when the limit to the hand's activity is experienced as a sympathetic response to an alien force, like it yet distinct from it, that the stone is presented in their grasp. Haptic touch discloses the overall shape and volume of the stone by grasping it. Its roughness is disclosed by feeling it. Its heft, by weighing it. Grasping, feeling, weighing, listening, and looking are all outward extensive activities by which the perceiver opens themselves up, in a directed manner, to the sensible, in all its varieties. The activity of the perceiver is a necessary precondition for the objective disclosure of the perceived object. For it is the resistance that such activity encounters in the natural environment that makes possible the sympathetic presentation of the sensible world without.

I have been discussing perceptual objectivity and its epistemic significance. Specifically, I have been spelling out the conception of perceptual objectivity that one arrives at once one conceives of perception, in the hylomorphic fashion, in terms of the assimilation of form without matter, as sustained by the perceiver's activity, and the epistemic significance of the resulting conception of objectivity. However, much of what was claimed would remain true on any conception of perception that merely postulates an indispensable presentational element. Thus, for example, \citet{McDowell:2008fk} believes that perception affords the perceiver with a non-propositional mode of awareness that grounds an epistemic warrant, understood as an epistemic entitlement. McDowell neither endorses a hylomorphic conception of sensory presentation nor even entertains its neo-Platonic elaboration in terms of sympathy with the natural environment that resists the force of the perceiver's activity. However, the metaphysics of sensory presentation that I have defended, offers not only an explanation of the epistemic significance of perceptual phenomenology in the form of an analytic explication of its intelligible structure (chapter~\ref{sec:sympathy_and_haptic_perception}), but it also offers a further, distinct possibility.

If perceptual presentation is sympathetic presentation, then perception places us into the heart of things and allows us to experience them from within.  Perhaps sympathy at work in fellow-feeling would provide the most vivid and suggestive example. Fellow-feeling involves feeling along with the object of sympathy. One experiences their plight from within. The sympathetic presentation of an object in perceptual experience involves the perceiver placing themselves in the object, coinciding with it, and so experiencing it from within. The present account of sensory presentation in terms of sympathy naturally belongs to the broader neo-Platonic heritage of thinking of perception as placing the perceiver in its object. There is a way in which the present account, where sensory presentation is governed by the principle of sympathy, can make sense of this neo-Platonic heritage, though perhaps it is not the only way. On the understanding of this neo-Platonic heritage afforded by sympathy, perception presents how things are from within. Sympathy makes possible the presentation of a thing's inner nature, and thus one may perceive how a thing is in itself. Echoing Johann Friedrich Herbart, we may say ``the world is a world of things-in-themselves [and] the things-in-themselves are perceivable.'' If perceptual presentation is governed by the principle of sympathy, then the distinction between the phenomenal and the noumenal collapses.

\section{Perceiving Things in Themselves} % (fold)
\label{sec:perceiving_things_in_themselves}

Sympathy allows the perceiver to experience the presented object from within. In sympathetically presenting that object in their experience of it, the perceiver coincides with that object and experiences how that thing is in itself, its inner nature, albeit imperfectly, from a partial perspective. We can begin to make sense of these claims through critical examining of Langton's \citeyearpar{Langton:1998aa} defense of Kantian Humility.

Consider the following puzzle for Kant's position, first raised by Jacobi. According to Kant things in themselves exist and are the cause of phenomenal appearances. But, if Kant's critical philosophy is correct, then it would seem that we can have no knowledge of things in themselves. But if we have no knowledge of things in themselves, then how could we know that they exist and are the cause of phenomenal appearances? This puzzle prompts \citet[304]{Jacobi:1815bs} to remark of the first edition of the \emph{Kritik der reinen Vernunft} that without the presupposition of the thing in itself I ``cannot enter into the system, yet \emph{with} this presupposition I cannot remain in it'' (\citealt[335]{Guyer:1987xe}; for discussion of Jacobi's puzzle see \citealt[247--54]{Allison:1983ly}, \citealt[chapter 15]{Guyer:1987xe}, \citealt[chapter 1]{Langton:1998aa}).

Langton's interpretation of Kant provides a straightforward solution by qualifying our ignorance of things in themselves. The qualification proceeds on the back of a metaphysical interpretation of the distinction between phenomena and things in themselves. Things in themselves are substances that have intrinsic properties whereas phenomena are relational properties of substances \citep[20]{Langton:1998aa}. Our ignorance pertains not to the existence of things in themselves, nor to their relational effects, their causing in us of phenomenal appearances, but to their inner nature. We cannot know how a thing is in itself. We cannot know, specifically, its intrinsic properties \citep[13]{Langton:1998aa}.
