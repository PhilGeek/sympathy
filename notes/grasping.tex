\section{The Dawn of Understanding} % (fold)
\label{sec:grasping_and_the_dawn_of_understanding}

In a justly famous scene from \emph{2001: A Space Odyssey}, set to Richard Strauss' \emph{Also Sprach Zarathustra}, a hominid ancestor, squatting among the skeletal remains of a boar, reaches out and tentatively grasps a femur. It is telling that this is how Stanley Kubrick chose to dramatize the initial transformation, induced by an alien obelisk, of our hominid ancestors, that eventually gives rise to space-exploring humanity in the twenty-first century. Not only does our hominid ancestor grasp the femur, but they grasp as well an important application. Squatting among the skeletal remains, femur in hand, our hominid ancestor taps the bones in exploratory manner. Each strike of the femur grows in force until finally, in a crescendo of activity, they smash the boar's skull to pieces. Our hominid ancestor has reached a crucial insight, that an implement such as the femur might transform boar into prey. Moreover, the application generalizes. The femur might also be used as a weapon against competing groups of hominids. The acquired technology thus has political consequences. What is presently important, however, is the connection between grasping and cognition. We say we have grasped a situation when we have understood it. And philosophers are prone to speak of thinkers grasping the thoughts they think. Kubrick dramatizes the connection between grasping and cognition by having our hominid ancestor's grasping the femur among the boar's skeletal remains be the primal scene of a dawning understanding.

We have \emph{grasped} a situation when we have understood it. We have a \emph{grip} on it. If the understanding in question is practical, we might say that we have matters \emph{in hand}. Nor are tactile metaphors confined to forms of higher cognition. They persist as well in our description of perceptual awareness. Not only do we speak of recognizing an object that we see as grasping the object present in our perceptual experience, but the presentation in experience is itself a kind of grasping. Perception puts us in \emph{contact} with its object. In perceiving an object we \emph{apprehend} it. The tactile metaphors for perceptual awareness tend to be modes of assimilation, and \emph{ingestion} is a natural variant. Our hominid ancestor, looking up from the boar's remains, \emph{takes in} the scene before them. If they see the obelisk, then, in a manner of speaking common among contemporary philosophers of perception, the obelisk is the \emph{content} of our hominid ancestor's perception. But if the obelisk is the content of their perception then their perception of it is its container. To bring something into view so that it figures in the content of perception would be to contain it within that perception. But containment itself is a mode of assimilation. 

What makes tactile metaphors for perception apt? Tactile metaphors for perceptual awareness, even for non-tactile modes of awareness such as vision and audition, are primordial and persistent. Most contemporary philosophers of perception apply them unselfconsciously. That they do is a testament to the power of such metaphors. Understanding the power they have over us, understanding what makes them so compelling, we gain insight into the object of those metaphors. In understanding what makes grasping an apt metaphor for perception generally, we gain insight into the nature of perceptual presentation. Or so I shall argue.

We shall begin with a phenomenological investigation into the nature of grasping, a form of haptic touch. The investigation is phenomenological in that it seeks to uncover how grasping, understood as a mode of haptic perception, presents itself from within tactile experience. It is phenomenological because the object of investigation is restricted to perceptual appearances and not because of any methodology deployed in pursuing that investigation. The investigation thus need not involve ``bracketing'', nor need it confine itself to the deliverances of introspection in determining the nature of haptic appearance. Once we have a better understanding of how grasping presents itself from within tactile experience, we will be in a better position to understand why grasping also presents itself as an exemplar of perceptual presentation. 

Grasping may be an exemplar of perceptual presentation, but it does not follow that all perception is a form of touch. One may grant that tactile metaphors for perceptual awareness are apt while eschewing any such reductive explanatory ambitions. Such ambitions were rife in Greek antiquity. Thus \citet[39]{Lindberg:1977aa} observes that in the ancient world ``the analogy of perception by contact in the sense of touch seemed to establish to nearly everybodyâ€™s satisfaction that contact was tantamount to sensation, and it was not apparent that further explanation was required.'' Aristotle criticizes this explanatory strategy. Conceiving of non-tactile modes of perceptual awareness on the model of touch will seem explanatory insofar as touch is antecedently understood to be an unproblematic mode of perception. However, Aristotle's belaboring and not always completely resolving the \emph{aporiai} concerning touch in \emph{De Anima} \textsc{ii} undermines that assumption. And if further explanation is required, then we can no longer simply assume that contact is tantamount to sensation. Nevertheless, Aristotle accepts the aptness of the metaphor. Perception, for Aristotle, remains a mode of assimilation. The Stagirite defines perception as the assimilation of sensible form without the matter of the perceived particular. So acceptance of the aptness of the metaphor need carry with it no commitment to such reductive explanatory ambitions. Grasping may be apt metaphor for perception, even for non-tactile modes of perception awareness, without perception being reduced to a form of touch.

\section{Haptic Perception} % (fold)
\label{sec:haptic_perception}

% section haptic_perception (end)

Grasping is a form of haptic touch. Haptic touch involves active exploration of the tangible object. This can involve a range of different exploratory activities. Thus to discern the texture of an object the perceiver may deploy lateral movement across its surface. Holding a stone in its hand, our hominid ancestor may feel the roughness of the stone by rubbing their thumb across its surface. And its hardness may be felt by applying pressure to it. According to the taxonomy of \citet{Lederman:1987fr}, grasping is a distinctive exploratory activity that they describe as ``enclosure''. Grasping an object allows the perceiver to discern a different range of tangible qualities. If texture is perceived by lateral motion and hardness by applying pressure, grasping or enclose makes volume and global shape available in tactile experience (though, of course, grasping is itself a way of applying pressure to an object and, hence, a way of perceiving the hardness of the object grasped as well as other tangible qualities such as temperature and moistness). With enclosure, Lederman and Klatzky write:
\begin{quote}
	\ldots the hand maintains simultaneous contact with as much of the envelope of the object as possible. Often one can see an effort to mold the hand more precisely to object contours. Periods of static enclosure may alternate with shifts of the object in the hand(s). \citep[346--7]{Lederman:1987fr}
\end{quote}
The quoted passage brings out several important features of grasping, understood as a mode of haptic perception. 

First, grasping a rigid, solid body involves the hand's maintaining simultaneous contact with as much of its overall surface as possible. Grasping is thus a kind of incorporation. Recall, what unites the various tactile metaphors for perception, even for non-tactile modes of perceptual awareness such as vision and audition, is that they tend to be modes of assimilation, and grasping exemplifies this pattern. It may not be as complete an incorporation as the variant, ingestion, but it remains a clear mode of assimilation nonetheless. As we shall see, that the grasping hand assimilates to the object grasped is a manifestation of the objectivity of that haptic perception. This is part of what it makes it an apt metaphor for perceptual presentation more generally.

Second, not only does the grasping hand assimilate to the overall shape and volume of the object grasped, but, as Lederman and Klatzky observe, effort is typically exerted to mold the hand more precisely to object's contours. So grasping or enclosure involves not only the hand's configuration in maintaining simultaneous contact with the overall surface of the object, but the force of the hand's activity as well. Not only is this force exerted in achieving the end of molding the hand more perfectly to contours of the object grasped, but it is exerted as well in the end's achievement---maintaining simultaneous contact with the overall surface of the object requires continued effort to sustain. This is physiologically and phenomenologically significant. It is physiologically significant in that the activation of different sets of receptors are coordinated in haptic perception. Grasping or enclosure will involve not only cutaneous activation but also the distinct set of activations involved in kinesthesis. Moreover, there is a reflection of this in the phenomenology. We feel the force with which we grip the object as well as the object's overall shape and volume.

Third, there is tendency, in grasping or enclosure, to shift the object periodically in one's hands. What explains this? Lederman and Klatzky observe that there is a tendency for perceivers to exert effort to mold their hand more precisely to the contours of the object grasped. In grasping an object, the grasping hand in this way assimilates to the overall shape and volume of the object grasped. Consider grasping a solid, rigid body, such as a stone. In grasping a stone, our hominid ancestor extends their hand's activity, they tighten their grasp, until they can no more. Since the stone is solid, it resists penetration. Since it is rigid, it maintains its overall shape and volume even when in the hominid's grasp. Contrast the way the overall shape and volume of an elastic body, such a sponge, deforms as it is squeezed. With the stone in its grip, the hand of our hominid ancestor assimilates to the overall shape and volume of the stone. Of course, hands are unevenly shaped and imperfectly elastic. This means that an effort to mold one's hand to a rigid body thus disclosing its overall shape and volume will, most likely, be imperfectly realized. There may be some areas of the object's surface that the grasping hand does not conform to. The tendency to shift the grasped object in our hands compensates for this partial and imperfect disclosure. In shifting the object in one's hand, an area that the hand did not previously conform to may become accessible to touch. Successive grips and the manner in which the object moves in one's hands as one shifts between them may provide a better overall sense of the shape and volume of the rigid body. 

Allow me to make two further observations about this passage, though now about issues that are merely implicit.

First, grasping is an activity and so is spread over time. It has duration. Not only does our hominid ancestor tentatively reach out and grasp the boar's femur from amongst its skeletal remains---an event with duration---, but its grasp must be actively maintained over a period of time. Maintaining simultaneous contact with the overall surface of a rigid body, or some nonsignificant portion of it, is a state sustained by activity. In this regard, it is like Ryle's \citeyearpar[149]{Ryle:1949qr} example of keeping the enemy at bay. The state thus obtains for the duration of the sustaining activity. Moreover, in coming to perceive its overall shape and volume, the perceiver may shift the object in their hand. The tactile sense of an object's overall shape or volume is disclosed by such activity. And since activity has duration, it is disclosed over time. The presentation of the overall shape and volume of an object in tactile experience is itself spread over time like the activity that discloses it. One potential lesson, then, for the metaphysics of perceptual presentation, is that the presence of an object of perception may be disclosed over time. 

Second, that the grasping hand assimilates to the overall shape and volume of the object grasped is potentially epistemically significant. The full case for this will have to wait, but we can begin to get a sense of why this might be so. A rigid, solid body has a certain overall shape and volume prior to being grasped. Moreover, it is sufficiently rigid and solid to maintain that overall shape and volume even when grasped. In making an effort to more precisely mold the hand to the contours of the rigid object, the hand thus takes on, to an approximate degree, the overall shape and volume of the object grasped. That is to say, the hand takes on a certain configuration determined by the hand's anatomy, the activity of the hand, and the overall shape of the object grasped. And the hand, so configured, encompasses a region of a certain volume itself determined by the hand and the volume of the object grasped. That is the point of making an effort to more precisely mold the hand to contours of the rigid object. In engaging in such haptic activity, in molding one's hand more precisely to the contours of the object, the overall shape and volume of the object had prior to being grasped, and maintained in being grasped. explains, in part, the hand's configuration in grasping the object and the force that needs to be exerted to maintain that configuration. Suppose that it is our hand's configuration in grasping and the force that needs to be exerted in maintaining that configuration that discloses the overall shape and volume of the object. (If so, at least in the present instance, haptic perception is dependent on proprioception and kinesthesis, \citealt{O'Shaugh}.) Since the object's overall shape and volume explains the hand's configuration and force, if the object eludes the hand's grasp, then that configuration and force would not have occurred. Perhaps the objectivity of grasping, understood as a mode of haptic perception, consists in the grasping hand's assimilating to the tangible features of the object had prior to grasping.

It might be objected that, at least for certain graspings, it is possible for the object to be absent and yet the hand to be in a duplicate configuration. However, a felt difference would remain. Maintaining the hand's configuration in the absence of the object requires different musculature activity since the perceiver can no longer rely on pressing against the rigid body in maintaining that configuration. The different pattern of activation of receptors in muscles and joints will result in a felt difference. Compare leaning against a wall with making as if to lean against a wall. Sustaining that posture in the absence of the supporting wall can be difficult to do. Miming is an acquired skill. As Jacques Tati demonstrates in \emph{Cours du Soir}, it can be taught and learned. So in the case of duplicate configuration, where the hand takes on the configuration it would have had if it were grasping the object, while the hand's configuration has been maintained in the absence of the object, there is a felt difference in the force exerted.

That the grasping hand assimilates to the contours of the object grasped is potentially epistemically significant. It is, if not the source of that haptic perception's objectivity, then its manifestation. If in grasping an object, the hand's configuration and force discloses the object's overall shape and volume, and that configuration and force would not have occurred in the absence of the object grasped, then our tactile experience would not be as it is when we haptically perceive if that object were in fact absent. While not yet proof against a Cartesian demon, one can begin to see the potential epistemic significance of the effort exerted in more precisely molding one's hand against the contours of the object grasped. It is the means by which certain tangible qualities of an external body are disclosed in touch. 

In the \emph{Theaetetus} 156 a--c, Socrates elaborates the Secret Doctrine of Protagoras by providing an account of perception as the contingent outcome of active and passive forces in conflict. Grasping as a mode of haptic perception can seem to approximate to that account. At the very least, the felt shape and volume of the object grasped is determined by conflicting forces. On the one hand, there is the force exerted in molding the hand more precisely to the contours of the rigid body. On the other hand, there are the self-maintaining forces of the rigid body itself. A solid, rigid body, such as a stone picked up by a hominid ancestor, is no mere sum of matter. It has a form or material structure determined by forces that are the categorical basis for its rigidity and solidity \citep{Johnston:2006js}. Haptic perception is the joint upshot of the force exerted by the grasping hand and the self-maintaining forces of the object grasped. There remains a difference, however, from the account elaborated by Socrates. The overall shape and volume of the object and our haptic perception of them are not ``twin births'' as Protagoras maintains. The forces that determine the object's rigidity and solidity are sufficient to maintain the object's overall shape and volume within the hand's grasp. So the perceived tangible qualities of the external body inhere in that body prior to being perceived, whereas in the account attributed to Protagoras, the perceived object comes into being with the perceiver's perception of it. At least with haptic perception, this perceptual realism is sustained by the force of the hand's activity in conflict with the self-maintaining forces of the object grasped.

\section{A Puzzle} % (fold)
\label{sec:a_puzzle}

% To fully appreciate the epistemic significance of the force of the hand's activity in more precisely molding to the contours of the object grasped, we need an account of how it is that assimilating to an external body discloses the tangible qualities that inhere in that body prior to haptic perception. The question here is a ``how possible'' question \citep{Cassam:2007lq}. How is objective haptic perception so much as possible?

In discussing the objectivity of grasping, understood as a mode of haptic perception, we supposed that it is our hand's configuration in grasping and the force that needs to be exerted in maintaining that configuration that discloses the overall shape and volume of the object grasped. I believe this supposition to be both plausible and true, but once it is clearly stated, a puzzle immediately arises. 

Embodiment is a fundamental feature of animal existence and so a fundamental feature of the existence of primates like ourselves. An animal's awareness of its body is a mode of self-presentation. There may be more to an animal than is revealed in bodily awareness, bodily awareness nevertheless presents corporeal aspects of the animal whose awareness it is. Bodily awareness remains a mode of self-presentation even if its disclosure of the animal whose awareness it is is partial in this way. Let bodily awareness be understood broadly enough to comprise both proprioception and kinesthesis and potentially more besides. So bodily awareness affords the perceiver with, among other things, awareness of the configuration of their limbs as well as awareness of their motion. So understood, awareness of the hand's configuration in grasping and awareness of the force that needs to be exerted in maintaining that grasp are both modes of bodily awareness. And since bodily awareness is a kind of self-presentation so are awareness of the hand's configuration and awareness of the force exerted in maintaining it. 

Our puzzle now is this. How can a mode of self-presentation disclose the presence of some other thing? How can bodily awareness be leveraged into disclosing the presence of something external to the perceiver's body? What alchemy transmutes bodily sensation into tactile perception?

Our puzzle concerns whether grasping so much as could be a mode of haptic perception. Though our interest is presently restricted to grasping as a mode of haptic perception, we can, however, get a better sense of that puzzle by considering an analogous case. So consider felt temperature. Contrast two cases. In both cases you feel warm, and you feel warm to the same degree. But in the first case, you feel warm because of a fever, and in the second case, you feel warm because because of the ambient heat. In both cases, your body is warmed. They differ only in the source of the warmth, with whether the warmth of your body is internally or externally generated. And in both cases, you feel equally warm. Nevertheless, a phenomenological difference remains. In the second case, not only do you feel warm, but you feel, as well, the warmth in the ambient air. Indeed, the warmth you feel is in conformity with the warmth felt in the ambient air. What explains this phenomenological difference? How are tangible qualities felt in something external to the perceiver's body such that perceiver feels in conformity with such qualities?

The puzzle is not meant to underwrite skepticism about haptic perception or tactile perception more generally. We are taking it for granted that in grasping a stone, say, our hominid ancestor feels the overall shape and volume of that stone. We are taking it for granted that grasping is a mode of haptic perception that affords the perceiver awareness of tangible qualities that inhere in the object grasped. Our puzzle is not meant to underwrite skepticism about wether grasping is a genuine mode of haptic perception of the tangible qualities of external bodies so much as to underwrite a ``how possible'' question \citep{Cassam:2007lq}. How is it that the configuration of the hand and the force exerted in maintaining that configuration disclose the overall shape and volume of the object grasped? How is objective haptic perception so much as possible? The puzzle, then, is at best proof of an explanatory lacuna rather than proof of the impossibility of objective haptic perception.

There is an aspect of grasping or enclosure that has so far remained implicit in our discussion of it but is crucial for refining our how possible question in such a way as to point to an adequate solution. The perceiver, in exerting effort in more precisely molding their hand to the contours of the object grasped, encounters felt resistance to their efforts. It is because the self-maintaining forces of the body resist the hand's encroachment that the hand can assimilate to the body's contours. The forces that constitute the body's solidity ensure that the force of the grasping hand does not penetrate it. And the forces that constitute the body's rigidity ensure that it maintains its overall shape and volume despite the force of the hand's grasp. Maybe it is the hand's encounter with felt resistance that discloses the tangible qualities of an external body. The suggestion, here, is not merely that the puzzle overlooked the contribution of cutaneous activation to tactile awareness, but rather with how cutaneous activation interacts with kinesthesis and bodily awareness more generally in giving rise to the experience of an external limit to the body's activity

There is a long history connecting objectivity to felt resistance to touch. In the \emph{Sophist}, Plato recasts the Gigantomachy, the struggle for supremacy over the cosmos between the Olympian Gods and the Giants, as a metaphysical dispute. The Gods, or Friends of the Forms, insist that only imperceptible forms are most real. Against them, the Giants, the offspring of Gaia, insist that only material bodies exist:
\begin{quote}
	One party is trying to drag everything down to earth out of heaven and the unseen, literally grasping rocks and trees in their hands, for they lay hold upon every stock and stone and strenuously affirm that real existence belongs only to that which can be handled and offers resistance to the touch. (Plato, \emph{Sophist} 246a; Cornford in \citealt[990]{Hamilton:1989fk})
\end{quote}
For the Giants, felt resistance to touch has become a touchstone for reality. Only that which can be handled and offers resistance to touch is real. Even if one rejects the materialist metaphysics of the Giants, one can accept that the experience that grounds their materialist conviction is phenomenologically compelling. Grasping something which offers resistance to touch is a phenomenologically vivid and primitively compelling experience of what is external to us. The phenomenologically vivid and primitively compelling experience of felt resistance to touch will underwrite the dramatic episode involving Dr Johnson outside of a church in Harwich:
\begin{quote}
	After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeleyâ€™s ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, â€™till he rebounded from it, ``I refute it thus.'' This was a stout exemplification of the first truths of Pere Buffier, or the original principles of Reid and Beattie; without admitting which, we can no more argue in metaphysicks, than we can argue in mathematicks without axioms. To me it is inconceivable how Berkeley can be answered by pure reasoning \ldots \citep[\textsc{i} 471]{Boswell:1935fk}
\end{quote}
The reality of external matter was demonstrated in the resistance it offered to Dr Johnsonâ€™s foot, which rebounded despite its mighty force. It was a demonstration not in the sense of proof, since it is inconceivable how Berkeley can be answered in pure reasoning. Moreover, what was stoutly exemplified was metaphysically axiomatic, a first truth, but proof proceeds from axioms, it does not establish them. Rather Dr Johnsonâ€™s performance was a demonstration of first truths by showing or exhibiting them (on the character of Johnsonâ€™s refutation of Berkeley see \citealt{Patey:1986uq}). Dr Johnson's demonstration, like the Giants' before him, draws its dramatic power from the phenomenologically vivid and primitively compelling experience of felt resistance to touch.

How does felt resistance to touch disclose tangible qualities inhering in bodies prior to perception? In exerting effort to mold more precisely the hand to the contours of the object grasped, in assimilating to the object, the perceiver experiences felt resistance to touch, they experience a limit to the hand's activity. How does the limit to the hand's activity in grasping a solid, rigid body disclose its overall shape and volume? After all, not all limitations to the body's activity are due to its interaction with external bodies. There are internal limitations to the body's activity as well. We encounter an internal limitation to the body's activity due to fatigue or in an inability to touch one's toes. So not every experience of a limitation to the body's activities is due to the tangible qualities inhering in an external body prior to perception. So how is it that in grasping, or enclosure, the limitation to the hand's activity in molding more precisely to the contours of the object grasped and the consequent felt resistance to touch disclose that object's overall shape and volume? How does the experienced limitation to the hand's activity become, in haptic perception, an experience of the tangible qualities of an external body? How is it that by means of an experienced limitation to the hand's activity tangible qualities are felt in something external to the perceiver's body and felt in conformity to those qualities?

This then is the refined version of our how possible question: How is it possible for felt resistance to the hand's activity in grasping or enclosure to disclose a rigid body's overall shape and volume? Earlier I claimed that the refinement of our question could point to an adequate solution. Indeed we have all but stated it. Though perhaps that can only be appreciated once the solution is clearly in view.

\section{Sympathy} % (fold)
\label{sec:sympathy}

When our hominid ancestor reaches out and picks up a rough-hewn stone, perhaps in preparation to skirmish with a competing group of hominids, they feel the overall shape and volume of the stone in their grasp. It is not the hand's shape, the configuration of the hand in grasping or enclosure, that they haptically perceive though they may be aware of it. It is the stone's shape that is disclosed in their grasp. They feel the overall shape and volume in the stone, and its overall shape and volume are tangible qualities of the stone that their hand is felt to conform to. I shall make a suggestion that will be the basis for an answer to our refined how possible question. Specifically, feeling tangible qualities in something external to the perceiver's body and feeling in conformity with them can fruitfully be understood as due to the operation of sympathy. One obstacle to appreciating this concerns out present understanding of sympathy, where sympathy is a kind of emotional response to others akin to compassion or pity. The notion of sympathy that is being invoked as the principle governing haptic presentation is closer to the Stoic notion, if more abstract and not at all reliant on on their vitalistic metaphysics. Felt resistance to touch, insofar as it is the presentation of an object external to the perceiver's body, is a sympathetic response to the force that resists the hand's activity. Recall our refined version of our how possible question was this: How is it possible for felt resistance to the hand's activity in grasping or enclosure to disclose a rigid body's overall shape and volume? If feeling tangible qualities in something external to the perceiver's body and in conformity to them is due to the operation of sympathy then we have a basis for an answer. It is when the limit to hand's activity is sympathetically responded to as a countervailing force, as the hand's force encountering an alien force resisting it, one force in conflict with another, like it yet distinct from it, that the self maintaining forces of the body disclose that body's presence and tangible qualities to tactile awareness.

The proposal is that presentation in haptic perception is governed by the principle of sympathy. As I observed, our present conception of sympathy can be an obstacle to appreciating this. To overcome this limitation, as well as to introduce some claims about the operative notion of sympathy, it will be useful to consider briefly a select history. Specifically, I want to consider sympathy as a principle of action at a distance in Stoic physics, Plotinus' use of the Stoic notion in explaining vision, and Hume's use of sympathy in drawing the self--other distinction in social intercourse.
